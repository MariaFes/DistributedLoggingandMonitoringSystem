## Features

### High-level features for A2

My main goal for the new features is to create an application where we implement a simple logging system. Therefore, I am able to meet the following criteria:

- Understand and experiment with log messages - correlation id, context id, etc.
- This logging system would allow one machine to log multiple inputs from various servers.
- Begin with a single endpoint that reads and writes to my PSQL database from my logging system.
- Have a simple “dummy” page on the web browser that presents relevant information
